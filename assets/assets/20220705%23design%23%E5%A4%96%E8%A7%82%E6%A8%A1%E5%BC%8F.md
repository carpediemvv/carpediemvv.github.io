设计模式讲究的是一种平衡，和业务模型的匹配。

### 意图（Intent）

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

为子系统中的一组接口提供统一的接口。外观模式定义了一个更高级别的接口，使子系统更易于使用

### 动机（Motivation）



### 适用（Applicability）

- you want to provide a simple interface to a complexsubsystem. Subsystems often get more complex as they evolve. Most patterns, when applied, result in more and smaller classes. This makes the subsystem more reusable and easier to customize, but it also becomes harder to use for clients that don't need to customize it. A facade can provide a simple default view of the subsystem that is good enough for most clients. Only clients needing more customizability will need to look beyond the facade.
- there aremany dependencies between clients and theimplementation classes of an abstraction.Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and portability.
- you want to layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level. If subsystems are dependent, then you can simplify the dependencies between them by making them communicate with each other solely through their facades.

### Related Patterns

Abstract Factory can be used with Facade to provide an interfacefor creating subsystem objectsin a subsystem-independent way. Abstract Factory can also be used as an alternative to Facade to hide platform-specific classes. Mediator is similar to Facade in that it abstracts functionality of existing classes. However, Mediator's purpose is to abstract arbitrary communication between colleague objects, often centralizing functionality that doesn't belong in any one ofthem. A mediator's colleagues are aware of and communicate with the mediator instead of communicating with each other directly.In contrast, a facade merely abstracts the interface to subsystem objects to make them easier to use; it doesn't define new functionality, and subsystem classes don't know about it. Usually only one Facade object is required. Thus Facade objects are often Singletons
