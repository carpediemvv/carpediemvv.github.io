Adapter: An adapter provides a different interface to the object it adapts. In contrast, a proxy provides the same interface as its subject.However, a proxy used for access protection might refuse to perform an operation that the subject will perform, so its interface may be effectively a subset of the subject's. Decorator : Although decorators can have similar implementations as proxies, decorators have a different purpose. A decorator adds one or more responsibilities to an object, whereas a proxy controls access to an object. PROXY  Proxies vary in the degree to which they are implemented like a decorator. A protection proxy might be implemented exactly like a decorator. On the other hand, a remote proxy will not contain a direct reference to itsreal subject but only an indirect reference, such as "host IDand local address on host." A virtual proxy will start off with an indirect reference such as a file name but will eventually obtain and use a direct reference.
