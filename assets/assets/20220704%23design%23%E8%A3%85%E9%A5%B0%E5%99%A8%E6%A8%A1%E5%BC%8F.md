设计模式讲究的是一种平衡，和业务模型的匹配。

### 意图（Intent）

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

动态地将附加职责附加到对象。装饰器为扩展功能提供了一种灵活的替代子类的方法

### 动机（Motivation）



### 适用（Applicability）

- to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects.

  动态和透明地向单个对象添加职责，即不影响其他对象。

- for responsibilities that canbe withdrawn.

- when extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition maybe hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing.

  当通过子类化扩展不切实际时。有时大量的独立扩展是可能的，并且会产生大量的子类来支持每种组合。或者一个类定义可能是隐藏的，或者不能用于子类化。

Adapter : A decorator is different from an adapter in that a decorator only changes an object'sresponsibilities,not itsinterface;an adapter will give an object a completely new interface. Composite :A decorator  can be viewed as a degenerate composite with only one component. However, a decorator adds additional responsibilities—it isn't intended for object aggregation. Strategy: A decorator lets you change the skin of an object; a strategy lets you change the guts. These are two alternative ways of changing an object.
