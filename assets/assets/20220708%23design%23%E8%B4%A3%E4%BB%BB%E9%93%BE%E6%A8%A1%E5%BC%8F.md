设计模式讲究的是一种平衡，和业务模型的匹配。

### 意图（Intent）

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

避免耦合发送者和接收者只通过一个对象一次机会去处理请求，链接接收对象，让请求沿着这个链接通过，直到有对象处理它

### 动机（Motivation）



### 适用（Applicability）

Use Chain of Responsibility when

- more than one object may handle a request, and the handler isn't known a priori. The handler should be ascertained automatically.
- you want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
- the set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically.
