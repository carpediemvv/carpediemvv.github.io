设计模式讲究的是一种平衡，和业务模型的匹配。

### 意图（Intent）

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

运用共享技术来有效地支持大量细粒度对象的复用

它通过共享已经存在的对象来大幅度减少需要创建的对象数量、避免大量相似类的开销，从而提高系统资源的利用率。

### 动机（Motivation）



### 适用（Applicability）

The Flyweight pattern's effectiveness depends heavily on how and where it's used. Apply the Flyweight pattern when allof the followingare true:

- An application uses a large number of objects.
- Storage costs are high because ofthe sheer quantity ofobjects.
- Most object state canbe made extrinsic.
- Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state isremoved.
- The application doesn't depend on object identity. Since flyweight objects may be shared, identity tests will return true for conceptually distinct objects.

### Related Patterns

The Flyweight pattern is often combined with the Composite  pattern to implement a logically hierarchical structure in terms of a directed-acyclic graph with shared leaf nodes. It's often best to implement State and Strategy objects as flyweights.
